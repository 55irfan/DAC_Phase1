# Data Analytics with Cognos - Group 3(Public Health Awareness Campaign Analysis)

Public health awareness campaigns play a crucial role in disseminating essential health information, promoting healthy behaviors, and preventing the spread of diseases. This abstract provides a concise overview of the analysis conducted on such campaigns. The study examines the strategies, effectiveness, and impact of public health awareness campaigns to gain insights into their role in improving community health.

The analysis begins by exploring the diverse range of public health awareness campaigns, addressing issues such as vaccination, hygiene, nutrition, and disease prevention. It evaluates the strategies employed in these campaigns, which often include media, community outreach, and social media. The study assesses the effectiveness of these strategies in reaching and engaging the target audience.

Furthermore, the impact of public health awareness campaigns on individual behavior and health outcomes is examined. Research findings indicate that well-designed campaigns can influence behavior change, increase knowledge, and reduce the incidence of certain health issues. However, the analysis also highlights challenges related to campaign design, message effectiveness, and target audience receptivity.

Additionally, the study discusses the importance of partnerships between public health agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector in amplifying the impact of awareness campaigns. Collaboration and coordination are seen as key drivers in addressing complex public health challenges.

In conclusion, public health awareness campaigns are essential tools for promoting health and well-being within communities. This analysis sheds light on the strategies and outcomes of such campaigns, emphasizing their potential to effect positive change in public health, while also recognizing the need for ongoing evaluation and innovation to address emerging health issues.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis project, including the analysis of public health awareness campaigns. It involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing data to make it suitable for analysis. Here are the key data preprocessing steps for this topic:

Data Collection: Gather data from various sources as discussed in the previous response, including government reports, surveys, social media, and other relevant datasets.

1.Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicates: Identify and eliminate duplicate records to ensure data accuracy.
Handle missing data: Decide on a strategy for dealing with missing data, such as imputation, removal, or substitution.
Correct inaccuracies: Correct any obvious errors in the data, such as typos or incorrect values.
Standardize data: Ensure data is in a consistent format and units, especially when merging data from different sources.
Data Integration: If you're using data from multiple sources, integrate them into a unified dataset. This might involve merging datasets, aligning data structures, and resolving any inconsistencies.

2.Data Transformation:

Feature engineering: Create new features or variables that could be relevant for your analysis. For instance, calculate campaign exposure rates or engagement metrics.
Normalization and scaling: Scale numerical data to ensure all features have the same range, which can be important for certain analyses (e.g., clustering or neural networks).
Encoding categorical data: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Text Data Preprocessing: If your data includes text, perform text preprocessing:

3.Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
Stop word removal: Eliminate common words like "and" or "the" that don't add much meaning.
Stemming or lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form to improve analysis accuracy.
Text cleaning: Remove special characters, punctuation, and non-alphanumeric characters.
Data Reduction: Depending on the size of your dataset, you may need to reduce its dimensionality. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used for this purpose.

4.Data Splitting: Divide your dataset into training and testing sets to validate your analysis and predictive models.

5.Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in your data. Outliers can skew results and need to be addressed appropriately, either by removing them or transforming them.

6.Data Aggregation: Aggregate data as needed. This could involve summarizing data on a weekly or monthly basis, aggregating campaign metrics, or creating key performance indicators (KPIs).

7.Data Visualization: Visualize your data to identify patterns and anomalies. Data visualization can help in understanding data distributions and relationships before analysis.

8.Documentation: Keep detailed records of all data preprocessing steps, including the rationale for decisions made during this process. This is important for transparency and reproducibility.

9.Data Storage: Ensure that your preprocessed data is well-organized and stored in a secure and accessible manner. Use databases or structured file formats like CSV for easy retrieval.

Data preprocessing is a critical foundation for any data analysis project. The quality of your analysis depends on the accuracy and cleanliness of your data. It's important to document each step of preprocessing to ensure the transparency and repeatability of your work.
